# ScriptEmu
This is a PoC that demonstrates a way to combat obfuscation, it creates a complete environment match with the original API, and in the local environment emulates the entire script, then you can observe completely all the called functions in their order, as well as in each callback

## Where can this be used
- Fighting obfuscation
- Checking scripts without having a product
- Debugging the script
